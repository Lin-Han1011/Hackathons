# Hackathons
The repository contains my Hackathon projects.

The "COVID-19 Fatal Probability Calculator Project" is to utilize data solution to reveal deeper reasons behind COVID-19 fatal cases in Toronto. I created this model when I attended the Hack Instead 48 - hour event (August 8th to 9th, 2020). You may also have a look of my presentation link posted in YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZluhaOT8XgE&feature=youtu.be The dataset was downloaded from Toronto Open Data 'COVID-19 CASES IN TORONTO' : https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid 19 cases in toronto/.
